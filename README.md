 This is a HTML Quiz game application created using HTML, CSS and JS. 
 Currently I have provided only 3 questions. You can increase the number of questions in the JS file. 
 I have also included a timer of 15 secs. The user have to answer within the timer otherwise either they can quit the quiz or play again.
 This application provides an engaging UI and meakes the learning process easier.
